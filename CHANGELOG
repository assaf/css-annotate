2010-11-21 version 2.0.0

Rack support! Mount css-annotate in your Web app to serve annotated
CSS/SCSS/SASS along the originals. See README for examples.


If no commented styles, show all styles by default.

Remove dependency on Compass, but absolutely use Compass when installed.


2010-11-18 version 1.3.0

By default only show commented styles (the ones that matter).

Fixed rendering bug under Ruby 1.9.2.


2010-11-13 version 1.2.1

Fixed default syntax for CSS files.

Parsing errors now show as HTML.


2010-11-12 version 1.2.0

You can now run css-annotate as a Web server with the -s/--server option. Hit
refresh to reload your CSS.

Now attempts to guess syntax from file extension, so pointing to a SASS file
would just work.


2010-11-11 version 1.1.0

Added shortcut option -c, same as --commented.


2010-11-11 version 1.0.0

Changed options so --commented shows only commented rules.

Included Compass in dependencies.


2010-11-11 version 0.1.0
